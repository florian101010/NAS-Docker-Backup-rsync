## [3.5.3] - 2025-07-31 üéØ **HEALTHCHECK & BACKUP STATISTICS ENHANCEMENT**

### Fixed
- **Critical Healthcheck Issue**: Resolved missing healthcheck output at backup completion
  - Fixed empty `ALL_STACKS` array causing "‚ö†Ô∏è Keine Stacks f√ºr Healthcheck gefunden" message
  - Added explicit `discover_docker_stacks` call before healthcheck execution
  - Ensures reliable container status overview after every backup run
  - Eliminated silent healthcheck failures that left users without status information
  - **Enhanced Healthcheck Robustness**: Improved timeout handling and error recovery
    - Increased timeouts from 5s to 15s for 22 stacks compatibility
    - Removed temporary file dependencies for better reliability
    - Added fallback mechanisms using `docker inspect` for container status
    - Eliminated `--status running` flag for broader Docker version compatibility
    - Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
    - **CRITICAL FIX**: Added `set +e`/`set -e` error handling to prevent script termination
      - Prevents healthcheck from stopping after first stack due to `set -euo pipefail`
      - Ensures all stacks are processed even if individual Docker commands fail
      - Guarantees complete container status overview is displayed

- **Double Container Start Prevention**: Completely eliminated duplicate container startup cycles
  - Moved `trap - EXIT` deactivation before healthcheck to prevent cleanup loop
  - Prevents unintended `cleanup()` function execution during normal script completion
  - Eliminates confusing double "SCHRITT 3" execution in terminal output

### Enhanced
- **Backup Statistics Overview**: New comprehensive backup summary at completion
  - Added `show_backup_summary()` function with detailed backup metrics
  - Displays source vs backup file sizes (formatted with human-readable units)
  - Shows file and directory counts for source and backup locations
  - Integrated into status overview between container operations and healthcheck
  - Includes timeout protection (30s for size calculation, 20s for file counting)
  - Graceful fallback messages when calculations are unavailable

- **Robust Implementation**: Enhanced reliability and error handling
  - Timeout protection prevents hanging on large directory calculations
  - Thread-safe temporary file handling for concurrent operations
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary calculation files
  - Skips statistics display when `--skip-backup` option is used
  - Consistent implementation in both English and German scripts

### Technical
- **Improved Script Flow**: Optimized backup completion sequence
  - Healthcheck now guaranteed to execute with populated stack data
  - Clean separation between backup statistics and container health monitoring
  - Better user experience with comprehensive status information
  - Enhanced logging for troubleshooting and monitoring

## [3.5.2] - 2025-07-31 ‚ö° **PERFORMANCE & STABILITY OPTIMIZATION**

### Performance Improvements
- **Health Check Optimization**: Dramatically improved backup script performance
  - Removed individual 30-second health checks after each container start
  - Implemented consolidated health check integrated into final status overview
  - Reduced execution time by 11+ minutes for 22 stacks (eliminated 30s √ó 22 = 11min timeout overhead)
  - Better user experience with faster container startup process
  - No more separate "STEP 4" - seamlessly integrated into final report

### Enhanced
- **Container Health Monitoring**: Robust and compact health check implementation
  - Compact health status summary with clear visual indicators
  - Stack-level and container-level statistics in one overview
  - Better error reporting without script termination
  - Health check only runs when containers are successfully started (not in dry-run mode)
  - Integrated into final status overview instead of separate step

### Fixed
- **Script Stability**: Eliminated critical stability issues
  - Fixed script termination caused by health check failures
  - Prevented cleanup loop that caused container restart cycles
  - Robust error handling with fail-safe design (`return 0` guarantee)
  - Safe JSON processing with fallback mechanisms for jq operations
  - Defensive programming prevents script abort on health check errors

### Technical
- **Script Efficiency**: Optimized container management workflow
  - Eliminated timeout issues during container startup
  - Allows containers more time to fully initialize before health validation
  - Maintains comprehensive health monitoring without performance penalty
  - Consistent implementation in both English and German scripts
  - New `perform_consolidated_health_check()` function with compact reporting
  - Fail-safe design ensures script always completes successfully
